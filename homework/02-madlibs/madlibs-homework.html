		<h1>Madlibs Exercise</h1>

		<p><a href="materials/madlibs-homework-starter-code.zip">Download the madlibs-homework-starter-code.zip</a> to get started. </p>

		<h2>Due:</h2>
		<p>Wednesday, 7/20/2016 @ 6:30pm</p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Have you ever heard someone describe a startup as being “Like Uber for puppies” or “Like Amazon for kittens”? In this exercise, you’ll be building a website that auto-generates madlib sayings like “A startup that is X but for Y”. Here’s what we’ve given you to get started:</p>

		<h2>Given</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A zip file with a project template folder structure (download above).</li>
			<li>HTML/CSS: All the HTML and CSS is done for you, this is a JS only exercise.</li>
			<li>CSS: You shouldn’t need to do anything with the CSS (unless you want to tweak the styling).</li>
			<li>DOM manipulation: it's also done for you as we haven't covered these topics yet in class (click events & updating html on the page).</li>

			<li>A JavaScript file, "madlibs.js", that contains two arrays (startupX and startupY) that are pre-populated with startup names (feel free to add some of your own as well!).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

		<p>Your job is to add code to the JavaScript file that makes the “Generate New Startup” button work. Basically, when the user clicks that buttons, your JavaScript should generate a new madlib saying, which should appear inside the h1.</p>


		<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
		<p>Were you able to meet the minimum requirements for the exercise? Want an additional challenge? Here are two more features you can implement in your JavaScript:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Add functionality to make the “Favorite Startup” button work–when the “Favorite Startup” button is clicked, it should save that madlib saying to an array.</li>
			<li>Add functionality to make the “Print favorites” button work–when the “Print favorites” button is clicked, it should display all of the favorited startups in the array underneath the buttons in the paragraph element with the class of "list".</li>
		</ol>
